I made an effort to construct a data model for my Flask application that has a number of important attributes for the products. I discovered that interacting with the SQLite database in Flask via Flask-SQLAlchemy might function better online, however I ran into several issues and was unable to finish the project. My project was unsuccessful. I was unable to deployment.
